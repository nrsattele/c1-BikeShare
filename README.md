# c1-BikeShare

This is a submission for the 2019 Capital One Software Engineering Summit Challenge. LA bikeshare data was given and we were tasked with generating a webpage to visualize the data and display metrics covering average distance, bikesharing for commuting, and station popularity.

## Getting Started

Navigate to https://nrsattele.github.io/c1-BikeShare/

## To solve this challenge, build a web app that provides:

[x] Data Visuals: Display or graph 3 metrics or trends from the data set that are interesting to you.
[x] Which start/stop stations are most popular?
[ ] What is the average distance traveled?
[x] How many riders include bike sharing as a regular part of their commute?

### Optional Bonus Features:

[ ] How does ridership change with seasons? Types of passes used, trip duration, etc
[ ] Is there a net change of bikes over the course of a day? If so, when and where should bikes be transported in order to make sure bikes match travel patterns?
[ ] What is the breakdown of Trip Route Category-Passholder type combinations? What might make a particular combination more popular?
